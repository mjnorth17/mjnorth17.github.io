        <li><p>I have been a Network Engineer for about a decade now. I work with a small team of engineers managing a network of 
            around 1,000 nodes. I am both a lead routing engineer as well as a lead optical engineer. Various large projects have 
            included turning up a brown field optical network, multiple BGP upstream peers and various automation tasks. 
            A normal day may involve documenting projects, working with field technicians or deploying configurations in an 
            automated way. I have experience with routers, switches, console servers, virtual machine routers, and dwdm infrastructure.
            I support a wireless network with over 300,000 subs and a wireline network for residential and business customers.</p></li>
