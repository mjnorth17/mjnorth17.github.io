  <p class="head">Experience</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Network Engineer I, II, III - Nsight (2015 - Present)</li>
    <ul>
        <li><p>I have been a Network Engineer for about a decade now. I work with a small team of engineers managing a network of 
            around 1,000 nodes. I am both a lead routing engineer as well as a lead optical engineer. Various large projects have 
            included turning up a brown field optical network, multiple BGP upstream peers and various automation tasks. 
            A normal day may involve documenting projects, working with field technicians or deploying configurations in an 
            automated way. I have experience with routers, switches, console servers, virtual machine routers, and dwdm infrastructure.
            I support a wireless network with over 300,000 subs and a wireline network for residential and business customers.</p></li>
    </ul> 
    <li>Interim NOC Manager - Nsight (5 mo.)</li>
    <ul>
        <li><p>For five months I was tasked with running our NOC while a suitable replacement was found.
            This gave me amazing experience in running a team, being a leader and stepping out of my comfort zone that was Network 
            Engineering. There were many hurdles to overcome and a lot to learn in a short span of time. After my time was up I returned 
            to my Network Engineering role as a level III engineer. The leadership skills learned during my five months helped me 
            reach this new level and made me a better engineer. I use these skills daily to lead projects and act as a teacher to level I 
            and level II engineers in the form of trainings and documentation.</p></li>
